# Blender Normalize Spline

A simple clone of 3DSMax's 'Normalize Spline' feature. This addon is handy when you're trying map through a spline. Like coursing energy through a tube, and things like that. By default, you will get non-linear motion, since your spline control points are probably all over the place, but divided evenly. So, things travel quickly through big spans, and slowly through jammed up ones. This fixes that. 

To use, install and enable the python file, select a spline at the object level, open the Object menu, and you should see 'Create Normalized Spline'.

The addon will create a copy of the spline in place, normalizing the points. You will get options for more divisions.
Lower numbers will get you more definition.
