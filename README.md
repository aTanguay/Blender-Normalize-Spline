# Blender Normalize Spline
 A clone of 3DSMax's 'Normalize Spline' feature.

To use, select a spline at the object level, open the Object menu, and you should see 'Create Normalized Spline'.

The addon will create a copy of the spline in place, normalizing the points. You will get options for more divisions.
Lower numbers will get you more definition.
